# Processor Emulator

A multi-purpose emulator and analysis toolkit for set-top boxes, firmware images, and embedded systems.  
Supports generic CPU/OS emulation, RDK-V/B, Uverse, DirecTV firmware analysis, filesystem probing, and more.

## Features

- **Generic CPU/OS Emulation:**  
  Load and emulate binaries for a wide range of architectures (MIPS, ARM, x86, PowerPC, SPARC, etc.) using QEMU or custom emulators.

- **RDK-V Emulator:**  
  (Planned) Emulate RDK-V set-top box environments for research and reverse engineering.

- **RDK-B Emulator:**  
  (Planned) Emulate RDK-B broadband gateway environments.

- **Simulate SWM Switch/LNB:**  
  (Planned) Simulate DirecTV SWM switches and LNBs for testing and analysis.

- **Probe Filesystem:**  
  Analyze and identify the type of filesystem in a given image or partition.

- **Emulate CMTS Head End:**  
  (Planned) Simulate a Cable Modem Termination System (CMTS) head end for DOCSIS research.

- **Uverse Box Emulator:**  
  (Planned) Emulate AT&T Uverse set-top boxes, including WinCE-based environments.

- **DirecTV Box/Firmware Analysis:**  
  Analyze DirecTV firmware images for structure, content, and possible vulnerabilities.

- **Linux Filesystem Read/Write:**  
  (Planned) Read and write to Linux filesystems (ext2/3/4, JFFS2, UBIFS, etc.) from Windows.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Processor-Emulator.git
   ```

2. **Install QEMU:**  
   Download QEMU for your platform and place the binaries in a folder *outside* this repository (see `.gitignore`).

3. **Build the project:**  
   Open the solution in Visual Studio and build.

4. **Run:**  
   Launch the application. You will be presented with a menu of emulation and analysis options.

## Usage

- **Generic CPU/OS Emulation:**  
  Select a binary or firmware image. The tool will attempt to detect the architecture and OS, and launch the appropriate emulator.

- **Other Modes:**  
  Select the desired mode from the main menu. Some features are stubs and will display a message until implemented.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome!  
If you want to add support for a new architecture, device, or analysis tool:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch.
3. Add your code (see `Emulation/StubEmulators.cs` for emulator stubs).
4. Document your changes.
5. Submit a pull request.

**Guidelines:**
- Keep code modular and well-commented.
- Use stubs for unimplemented features.
- Update this README with new features or changes.

## Project Structure

- `MainWindow.xaml.cs` - Main application logic and UI event handlers.
- `Emulation/` - Emulator classes for each supported architecture.
- `Tools/` - Utilities for disassembly, filesystem analysis, etc.
- `README.md` - This file.
- `.gitignore` - Ignores QEMU binaries and other non-source files.

## Notes

- This project does **not** include QEMU binaries. Download them separately.
- Some features (RDK, Uverse, DirecTV, CMTS, Linux FS) are planned and not yet implemented.
- WinCE version detection is heuristic and may require user input.
